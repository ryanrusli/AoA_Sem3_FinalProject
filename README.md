# Analysis of Algorithms 

Compression project for our **Analysis of Algorithms** course at BINUS University.

#### How to setup and run locally
This project is written in python and managed with **pipenv**. It's the recommended way of managing virtual environments and python packages for python based projects according to python's current documentation. When python and pip is installed on your local machine you can install **pipenv** by running the this command in your terminal (should work on both *nix and windows machines):

```bash
$ pip install pipenv
```

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ryanrusli/AoA_Sem3_FinalProject.git`

Change directories into the repository and run `pipenv shell`. This should automically install all the required packages to run the application locally.
